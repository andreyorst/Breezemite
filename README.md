## F.A.Q.

**Q.** My borders are oversised!  
**A.** Check if you're using **display scaling**. This theme is sensitive to it (my fault)

**Q.** Titlebar is transparent!  
**A.** Youre usind **HiDPI** dipllay, right? check [this issue](https://github.com/andreyorst/Breezemite/issues/4#issuecomment-295890785) for solution. If not, open new issue and I'll try to help you

**Q.** No shade (roll up) button!  
**A.** Yes. No shade button. It is bugged in aurorae theme engine.

**Q.** Damn, draggable area of borders is 1px!  
**A.** Yes, i know, [this it what matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MycEcQOSzc). [Check this issue](https://github.com/andreyorst/Breezemite/issues/2)

**Q.** Icon for title bar Application Menu button is missing!  
**A.** Check [this](https://github.com/andreyorst/Breezemite/issues/5) issue for explanations.

**Q.** Incorrect Application Menu position!  
**A.** I personally recommend you to use this theme with application menu widget, since it is a mac style theme. But check [this](https://github.com/andreyorst/Breezemite/issues/6) issue for explanations.
